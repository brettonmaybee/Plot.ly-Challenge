Data Class Assignment #15
**** IMPORTANT While I attempted to complete this assignment without using the provided solution, I was ultimately unsuccessful. The finished working code in this repository is based primarily on the solution provided after the assignment was initially graded. I want to make it clear that I do not intend to be disengenous about my work or to take credit for code that is not my own. I spent a long time trying to complete this independently, however in the end I was unable to create working code on my own without the solution provided. I have added my own notes to show that I have do have a basic understanding of what is going on, and the general logic involved.

This repository contains a project that presents interactive charts to explore belly button bacteria data. The d3 library is used to read a json file containing data on the types of bacteria found in peoples belly buttons. This data is presented as a bar chart showing the top 10 barteria samples collected for each patient as chosen via a drop down menu, and a buble chart it used to show the frequency of each sample on a single chart.
