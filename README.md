Data Class Assignment #15
**** IMPORTANT While I attempted to complete this assignment without using the provided solution, I was ultimately unsuccessful. The finished working code in this repository is based primarily on the solution provided after the assignment was initially graded. I want to make it clear that I do not intend to be disengenous about my work or to take credit for code that is not my own. I spent a long time trying to complete this independently, however in the end I was unable to create working code on my own without the solution. I have however added my own notes to show that I have do have a basic understanding of what is going on, and the general logic of the involved.

This repository contains a project that presents interactive charts to explore belly button bacteria data.
